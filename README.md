# 📊 Data Structure Visualization

Welcome to the Data Structure Visualization project! This repository provides interactive visualizations of various data structures and algorithms commonly studied in computer science.

## 🌟 Overview

Explore interactive visualizations for understanding the operations and behaviors of essential data structures and algorithms:

- **Stack**: Demonstrates the Last In First Out (LIFO) principle.
- **Queue**: Illustrates the First In First Out (FIFO) principle.
- **Bubble Sort**: Visualizes the bubble sort algorithm for sorting elements.
- **Selection Sort**: Shows the selection sort algorithm in action.
- **Linear Search**: Demonstrates the linear search algorithm for finding elements.
